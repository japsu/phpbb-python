PHPBB AUTHENTICATION IMPLEMENTED IN PYTHON
==========================================

Introduction
============

phpbb-python implements the authentication part of phpBB3 in Python. This
enables Python-based web applications to authenticate against the user
account database of an existing phpBB3 discussion board.

A Django authentication backend is also provided. Tested with phpBB 3.0.7,
Django 1.0 and PostgreSQL 8.4. Other configurations may or may not work.

This documentation assumes extensive knowledge of the internals of both
Django and phpBB3. Not for the faint of heart. Use the Source, Luke.


Copyright and licensing
=======================

This is a very direct port of the login code in phpBB3 itself. Thus this
package can be considered a derivative work of phpBB3 and the license of
phpBB3 (GPLv2, sadly not "or later") applies.

However, should the phpBB3 software some day be relicensed to GPLv2 or
later, I won't stop you from using this package with the "later" licenses.
Therefore, files that I don't consider derivative of phpBB3 carry only my
copyright notice and the "GPLv2 or later" license boilerplate.

For legal stuff, see the files COPYING and LICENSE.


Basic usage (without Django)
============================

from phpbb.auth.sql import setup
from phpbb.auth.auth_db import login_db

import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    database="phpbb3",
    user="phpbb3",
    password="phpbb3"
)
setup(conn)

result, user_row = login_db("username", "password")
if result == "LOGIN_SUCCESS":
    print "Multipass!"
else:
    print "You shall not pass!"


Usage with Django
=================

Make sure the "phpbb" module is somewhere in your PythonPath. Add this
to your settings.py:

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    ('django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend'),
    ('phpbb.auth.backends.PhpbbBackend'),
)

PHPBB_AUTH_DB_MODULE = "psycopg2"
PHPBB_AUTH_DB_KEYS = {
    "user": "",
    "password": "",
    "database": "",
}
PHPBB_AUTH_DB_PARAM_STYLE = "%s"
PHPBB_AUTH_DB_USERS_TABLE = "phpbb_users"

Obviously, there's some filling in to do. Notice how we left ModelBackend in,
too. This way we can define superusers etc. in Django and just the peons in
phpBB3.

There's a working (WORKSFORME) example in examples/hammertime. Have fun.
